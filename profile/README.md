<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

<p align="center">The 42Stellar organization is the direct continuation of the <a href="https://stud42.fr">stud42.fr</a> project. When <a href="https://github.com/42Atomys">@42Atomys</a> (aka. Atom) created stud42, he announced that the project would be open source when he left 42 staff.</p>

<p align="center">3 years later, it's finally time, time to put the project that doesn't need to prove itself anymore in open source, so that this project becomes the project of every student of every campus in the world.</p>

<h3 align="center">Stud42 becomes 42Stellar :tada: </h3>
